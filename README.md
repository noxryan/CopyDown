Copy Down Extension for Visual Studio 2012


This works similar to the "ctrl+d" command found in Notepad++ as well as some other editors.
Duplicates the current line without using the clipboard.
This was a macro that has been converted to an extension to work with VS2012.


Run Built/CopyDown.vsix and navigate to Tools->Options->Environment->Keyboard to map the CopyDown command.
